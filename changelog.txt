v1.2.0
Holotape is now a quest item to prevent loss.  Added ability to despawn unusuable Power Armor Frames after spawning them.  Internal refactors for much cleaner uninstallation process.

v1.1.0
Nearly every item spawns in the spawn cabinet because the out-in-the-open style caused issues.  Added chair so the player can wait.

v1.0.2
Fixed a bug where the AiO release would allow bundled packages to be uninstalled and a design failure in the package versioning system.  Unless you're running the AiO release, please update all Cheat Bunker packages to match this update.

v1.0.1
Fixed a bug that caused the wrong teleportation effect to be applied to the wrong actor objects at the wrong times

v1.0.0
Initial release
