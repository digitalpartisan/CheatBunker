Cheating. You shouldn't do it. If you're on your first play-through, that is. We didn't. But Fallout 4 suffers from an immense lack of replay-ability for several reasons and The Cheat Bunker is here to help augment your subsequent experiences. Eventually, we all use mods that are implicitly cheats to either work around bugs or just for fun and The Cheat Bunker aims to do both!

Features:
Holotape which replicates nearly all of the terminals in the bunker
Endless supply of each non-unique clothing, armor, weapon, and mod item
Custom armors and weapons with legendary effects exclusive to the Cheat Bunker
Fast travel features which let you teleport anywhere on the current map similar to the Institute's teleporter as well as execute a snapback teleportation (see manual for details)
Companion controls including the ability to acquire their perks, repair damaged relationships, track their location, and move them to the player.  Tracking and actor movement behaviors available for Dogment.  Compatible with Everyone's Best Friend http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/13459/? by valdacil
Character progression options including the ability to add levels and perk points, auto-progress insufferable quests, maximize SPECIAL stats, and acquire an exclusive perk called “Player Knowledge” which slightly boosts your XP gains and scales with your Intelligence
Spawn any suit of Power Armor the Bunker knows about as well as that suit's mods
A package system that supports DLC additions and could be used to import any content related to other mods or even game overhauls

Quest Auto-completion options:
“Long Time Coming” Holotapes http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Long_Time_Coming
